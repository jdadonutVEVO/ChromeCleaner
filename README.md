## ChromeCleaner
Automatically clears Chrome browsing activity. 


# Plans
1. Version 1 or Beta will be able to either interact with the chrome app/program to delete browsing history, search history, and cookies for pre-defined sites. Getting into settings requires a passcode to protect user data from straggling programs. 

2. Version 2 will be able to clear the activity of a value equal or higher than the amount of time in a pre-disclosed app/website in myactivity.google.com. Settings of this will also require a passcode to be released. 

3. Version 3 will be able to clear history on all accounts connected to a device, and after this release, will start implementing standalone status and will being to allow other bowsers to be cleared.
